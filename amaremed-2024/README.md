# AMARE-MED 2024: Spatial and spatiotemporal models with sdmTMB for estimating species distribution and index standardization

In this portion of the course, we will introduce fitting spatial and spatiotemporal generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) with Gaussian random fields. Such models are increasingly used for species distribution modelling and survey index standardization. They can be particularly useful when accounting for differences in survey protocols or incorporating climate variables. We will introduce this class of models and focus on fitting and understanding them with sdmTMBâ€”an R package with a flexible and user-friendly interface.

Topics will include:
* An introduction to Gaussian random fields
* An introduction to the sdmTMB R package
* Spatial random field GLMMs
* Spatiotemporal random field GLMMs
* Index standardization
* Model checking and comparison
* Accounting for islands or coastal protrusions
* Combining data sources
* Incorporation of climate covariates
* Comparing distribution and overlap between stocks

While all examples will use sdmTMB, similarly structured models can be fit with INLA or VAST and so the concepts will also be applicable to participants using these packages. The workshop will consist of presentations, tutorials, and group exercises with the support of instructors.
