# sdmTMB limitations

sdmTMB fits a variety of models with univariate responses

sdmTMB: 
* does not fit multivariate models ([see VAST](https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST))
* does not conduct spatial (dynamic) factor analysis ([see VAST](https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST))

# Troubleshooting

---

# Example of non-converging model

.small[
```{r pcod-spatial-rf, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
mesh <- make_mesh(pcod, xy_cols = c("X", "Y"), cutoff = 10)

fit <- sdmTMB(
  present ~ depth * year,
  data = pcod,
  mesh = mesh,
  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
  spatial = "on"
)
```

```r
#> Warning message:
#> The model may not have converged: 
#> non-positive-definite Hessian matrix. 
```
]
---

# Who is Hessian and why are they not "positive definite"?

* A Hessian matrix is a matrix of second derivatives of a function (here the log likelihood surface)

--

* The inverse of the negative Hessian is the parameter covariance matrix

--

* Warning means the curvature of the log-likelihood surface is inconsistent with the model having found the best fit

--

* Overparameterized? Variance estimated near zero?

--

* See [vignette("troubleshooting", "glmmTMB")](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmmTMB/vignettes/troubleshooting.html)

# Inspecting output

One or more standard errors being `NaN` is a problem:

.small[
```{r, echo=TRUE, highlight.output=11}
fit
```
]

---

# Inspecting output

We could also look directly at the TMB `sdreport`:

.small[
```{r, echo=TRUE, highlight.output=c(6, 9, 10, 11)}
fit$sd_report
```
]

---

# Looking at gradients

Log likelihood gradient with respect to fixed effects:

.small[
```{r, echo=TRUE}
max(fit$gradients)
```
]

* Gradient becomes smaller as likelihood surface becomes flatter at the location in parameter space

--

* Flatter surface = closer to point of maximum likelihood

--

* So, small values are consistent with convergence (no hard rule, perhaps at least < 0.001 but depends on scale of log likelihood)

---

# Sanity function - an useful wrapper

* the `sanity()` function checks all of the above mentioned inspection points

.small[
```{r checksanity, eval=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
sanity(fit)
```
]

---

# Interpretation of the above model

* Linear interaction term seems tricky to estimate

* Solutions:
  * make sure the model is identifiable
  * drop linear interaction (maybe not important)
  * try re-scaling predictors
  * try a different mesh setup
  * simplify some other part of the model
  * try a related fixed-effect structure, e.g., non-linear smooths
  
---

# Smooth effects by year

For example, separate smooths by year:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
pcod$fyear <- as.factor(pcod$year)
fit <- sdmTMB(
  present ~ s(depth, by = fyear), #<<
  data = pcod,
  mesh = mesh,
  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
  spatial = "on"
)
```

---

# Tips with mesh 

Unfortunately, there is no "fit-for-all" mesh

It all depends on data (distance between survey points, etc) but check that the estimated `Matern range > mesh size (cutfoff)`

```{r eval = TRUE, echo=TRUE}
#Spatial model fit by ML ['sdmTMB']
#[...]
#Matern range: 37.06   #<<

# data 
quantile(dist(fit$data[,c("X","Y")]), c(0.01,0.05,0.1))
# mesh
quantile(dist(fit$spde$mesh$loc[,1:2]), c(0.01,0.05,0.1))
```

---

class: center, middle, inverse

# Residuals diagnostics

---

# Randomized quantile residuals - default

.xsmall[
```{r resid1, echo=TRUE, out.width='500px', fig.width=6}
set.seed(1)
rq_res <- residuals(fit) 
qqnorm(rq_res)
qqline(rq_res)
```
]

.xsmall[
Warning: these residuals are fast but might look off even if the model is fine. Also see MCMC residuals. See the ['Residual checking' vignette](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/residual-checking.html).
]

---

# Model residuals in space

.xsmall[
```{r resid2, echo=TRUE, out.width='700px', fig.width=6}
pcod$resids <- residuals(fit)
filter(pcod, year %in% c(2011, 2013, 2015, 2017)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(X, Y, colour = resids)) + #<<
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  scale_colour_gradient2() +
  coord_fixed()
```
]

---

# Model residuals in space (continue)

.small[
```{r resid3, echo=TRUE, out.width='700px', fig.width=6, eval=TRUE}
pred_fixed <- fit$family$linkinv(predict(fit)$est)
s_fit = DHARMa::createDHARMa(
  simulatedResponse = simulate(fit, nsim=500) ,
  observedResponse = pcod$present,
  fittedPredictedResponse = pred_fixed
)
DHARMa::testSpatialAutocorrelation(s_fit, x= pcod$X, 
                                   y=pcod$Y, plot=FALSE)
```

# Words of wisdom

**Start simple!**

--

These are complex models:

--

* May take a while to fit (`silent = FALSE`)

--

* Easy to create configurations that won't converge

--

* Can also be hard to wrap your head around

---

# Words of wisdom

--

Options for starting simple:

--

* Start intercept only

--

* Start with a spatial not spatiotemporal model

--

* Start without random fields:  
  `spatial = 'off', spatiotemporal = 'off'`
  
--

* Start with coarse meshes, maybe increase later  
  .xsmall[Mesh resolution greatly impacts speed and finer is not always better; can affect convergence.]

---

# More words of wisdom


--

* Make lots of plots  
  .xsmall[Plot the raw data, predictions, random fields, residuals, ...]

--

* Don't get too caught up in model configuration  
  .xsmall[Many are only subtly different and can produce similar predictions]

--

* Consider the scale of the response and predictors
  .xsmall[Keep parameters not too big or small; standardizing variables?]

--

* Consider if observation error variance (phi) >> process variance (sigma_O and/or sigma_E)  
  .xsmall[Known to be problematic for state-space models]
  
---

# And a few more 

* Make sure the estimated spatial range > mesh size (cut-off value)

--

* large SE in the TMB `sdreport` might suggest overparametrization
