# Why might we want time-varying effects?

* Time-varying slopes: 
  * To allow for evolving responses to covariates (e.g., species moving deeper over time)
  
  * Example use: [English et al. (2021) Fish and Fisheries](https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12613)  
    Modelled groundfish density with depth; didn't want to constrain fish if they were moving deeper when water was warmer
  
* Time-varying intercepts:
  * To allow variable means across time with constraints
  * To have a model to interpolate or forecast over time
]

# Time-varying intercepts

Several ways in sdmTMB:

* factors: `as.factor(year)` (independent)
* random effects: ` + (1 | year)` (drawn from normal distribution)
* smooth: ` + s(year)`
* as random walk (shown next)

#  Random walk covariates in sdmTMB

Random walk:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_t &= x_{t-1} + \epsilon_t\\
\epsilon &\sim \mathrm{Normal(0, \sigma^2)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Defined by `time_varying` argument

Takes a *one-sided* formula, e.g. `~ 1` or `~ 0 + depth`

Note: initial coefficient is unconstrained, i.e. **do not place the same covariate in 
the `formula` argument** (this includes the intercept)

---

# Time-varying intercept

Note: a `0` or `-1` in formula for suppressing global intercept

Otherwise, both the main effects and time-varying effects would have the same parameter and this can't be estimated.

Time-varying (random walk) effect of depth

<!-- To plot these, we make a data frame that contains all combinations of the time-varying covariate and time. This is easily created using `expand.grid()` or `tidyr::expand_grid()`. -->

```{r tv-depth-eff}
nd <- expand.grid(
  depth_scaled = seq(min(pcod$depth_scaled) + 0.2,
    max(pcod$depth_scaled) - 0.2, length.out = 100),
  year = unique(pcod$year)
)
nd$depth_scaled2 <- nd$depth_scaled^2
p <- predict(fit_tv, newdata = nd, se_fit = TRUE, re_form = NA)

p$depth <- exp(nd$depth_scaled * pcod$depth_sd[1] + pcod$depth_mean[1])
ggplot(p, aes(depth, exp(est),
  ymin = exp(est - 1 * est_se),
  ymax = exp(est + 1 * est_se),
  group = as.factor(year)

# Time-varying coefficient notes

* `time_varying` is a formula for coefficients that follow a random walk over time

--

* Make sure a coefficient isn't in both `formula` and `time_varying`, this includes the intercept

--

* The `time_varying` formula cannot have smoothers `s()` in it! Instead:
  * Polynomials: `time_varying = ~ x + I(x^2)`
  * `formula = s(depth, by = factor_year)` (independent smooths) 
  * `formula = s(depth, year)` (2D smooth)
