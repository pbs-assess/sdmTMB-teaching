Hi all,

I'm running an sdmTMB workshop November 4-6 for TESA, both in person (Nanaimo PBS conference room) and online.

I'm reaching out because you've worked on projects using sdmTMB, and I'd love to showcase your work to participants. Would you be able to give a ~10 minute talk about your project? In-person would be ideal, but online works too.
I'm hoping you could cover:

- A brief background on your analysis and findings
- How you used sdmTMB in your modeling
- What problems it helped solve or challenges you faced

This will help participants understand what sdmTMB can do and how to apply it to their own work.

The schedule is flexible, so please let me know your availability. I'm hoping to group presentations into 2-3 short sessions.

Thanks!
Sean
